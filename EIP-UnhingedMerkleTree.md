## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standardized method for creating and verifying proofs across multiple blockchain networks using a hybrid tree structure with a clear two-part design: a balanced Merkle tree for efficient membership proofs combined with sequential hash chaining for linking across chains. This structure, named "Unhinged Merkle Tree," enables efficient and compact proofs for cross-chain operations while maintaining security guarantees.

## Motivation

Cross-chain operations have become increasingly important as blockchain ecosystems expand to multiple networks. However, current implementations lack a standardized, gas-efficient method for proving inclusion in multi-chain transaction sets. 

Common challenges in cross-chain operations include:
1. Gas inefficiency when verifying operations across multiple chains
2. Complexity in managing proofs for different chains
3. Difficulty in maintaining a single authorization signature for multiple chains
4. Lack of standardization in cross-chain proof formats

The Unhinged Merkle Tree structure addresses these challenges by:
1. Minimizing per-chain proof size through its hybrid two-part approach
2. Allowing a single signature to authorize operations across an arbitrary number of chains
3. Providing a standardized format for cross-chain proofs
4. Maintaining security guarantees while optimizing for gas efficiency

## Specification

### Definitions

- **Balanced Subtree**: A traditional Merkle tree for data within a single chain
- **Unhinged Chain**: A sequential hash chain connecting the roots of balanced subtrees
- **Leaf Node**: Individual data element in a balanced subtree
- **Subtree Root**: The root hash of a balanced Merkle tree for a single chain
- **Unhinged Root**: The final hash resulting from the sequential chaining of subtree roots

### Two-Part Structure

The key insight of the Unhinged Merkle Tree is its distinct two-part structure:

```
               [H1] ‚Üí [H2] ‚Üí [H3] ‚Üí ROOT
            /      \      \      \
          [BR]    [D5]   [D6]   [D7]  
         /     \
     [BH1]     [BH2]
    /    \     /    \
[D1]    [D2] [D3]  [D4]
```

Where:
- **Bottom Part**: A standard balanced Merkle tree for efficient membership proofs
  - [BR] is the balanced root
  - [BH1], [BH2] are balanced hash nodes
  - [D1]-[D4] are the leaf data points
  
- **Top Part**: A sequential hash chain for efficiently linking across chains
  - Starts with the balanced root [BR]
  - Incorporates additional data points [D5], [D6], [D7]
  - Creates the hash chain [H1] ‚Üí [H2] ‚Üí [H3] ‚Üí ROOT

This hybrid approach combines the benefits of both structures:
- Efficient membership proofs from the balanced part (O(log n) complexity) 
- Minimal gas usage from the sequential chain part
- Flexibility to include both tree-structured data and sequential data in a single signed root

The Unhinged Merkle Tree consists of:

1. **Balanced Subtrees**: Each chain has its own balanced Merkle tree of operations. These follow standard Merkle tree construction rules where leaf nodes are paired and hashed recursively until a single root hash is obtained.

2. **Unhinged Chain**: The roots of these balanced subtrees are chained sequentially to form the "unhinged chain" through iterative hashing:
   ```
   result = subtreeRoot1
   result = hashLink(result, subtreeRoot2)
   result = hashLink(result, subtreeRoot3)
   ...
   result = hashLink(result, subtreeRootN)
   ```

The final `result` is the Unhinged Root that can be signed using EIP-712 or other signature schemes.

### Proof Format

The proof format for an Unhinged Merkle Tree uses standard merkle proofs:

```solidity
bytes32[] unhingedProof;  // Array of sibling hashes forming the merkle proof
```

Where:
- `unhingedProof`: A standard merkle proof containing sibling hashes needed to reconstruct the path from a leaf to the root
- Uses ordered hashing (smaller value first) for consistency
- Compatible with OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof library

#### Verification Process

The Unhinged Merkle Tree uses standard merkle tree verification:

1. Start with the leaf (the hash of the current chain's permissions)
2. For each element in the proof array:
   - Apply ordered hashing: hash(min(current, proofElement), max(current, proofElement))
   - The result becomes the new current value
3. The final result should match the signed root

This approach provides several advantages:
1. Simple and well-understood verification algorithm
2. Compatible with existing merkle proof libraries
3. Efficient gas usage with minimal overhead
4. No complex proof structure parsing required

### Verification Algorithm

To verify an element is included in an Unhinged Merkle Tree:

1. **Start with the leaf**: The hash of the current chain's permissions
2. **Process each proof element**: For each `bytes32` in the proof array:
   - Determine ordering: `if (currentHash <= proofElement)`
   - Apply ordered hash: `currentHash = keccak256(currentHash, proofElement)` or `keccak256(proofElement, currentHash)`
3. **Compare with root**: The final hash should match the signed unhinged root

Example verification in Solidity:
```solidity
function verify(
    bytes32[] calldata proof,
    bytes32 root,
    bytes32 leaf
) internal pure returns (bool) {
    bytes32 computedHash = leaf;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < proof.length; i++) {
        bytes32 proofElement = proof[i];
        if (computedHash <= proofElement) {
            computedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(computedHash, proofElement));
        } else {
            computedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(proofElement, computedHash));
        }
    }
    return computedHash == root;
}
```

### Generating an Unhinged Merkle Tree

To generate an Unhinged Merkle Tree:

1. For each chain:
   - Collect all operations for that chain
   - Construct a balanced Merkle tree of these operations
   - Store the root hash of this tree

2. Create the unhinged chain:
   - Start with an empty hash or convention (e.g., `bytes32(0)`)
   - Iteratively hash with each subtree root in order
   - The final hash is the Unhinged Root to be signed

3. Generate proofs for each chain:
   - For each chain, create the appropriate `UnhingedProof` structure
   - Calculate the `preHash` based on all previous chains
   - Include the balanced subtree proof for the relevant elements
   - Include the roots of all subsequent chains in `followingHashes`

### Chain Ordering for Gas Optimization

For optimal gas efficiency, chains should be strategically ordered based on their calldata costs within the Unhinged Merkle Tree:

1. **Cost-Based Ordering**: Order chains from lowest calldata cost to highest calldata cost
   - Place chains with cheaper calldata (typically L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism) earlier in the sequence
   - Place chains with expensive calldata (like Ethereum mainnet) at the end of the sequence

2. **Benefits of This Approach**:
   - Minimizes proof size for expensive chains: Chain at the end of the sequence only needs a single preHash value
   - Optimizes overall cross-chain gas costs: Larger proof data is only required on chains where calldata is cheaper
   - Makes cross-chain operations more economically viable

While ordering by chain ID in ascending order provides consistency, the cost-optimized ordering provides significant gas savings. Implementations should document their ordering strategy clearly.

**Example**: For a cross-chain operation spanning Ethereum (expensive calldata), Arbitrum and Optimism (cheaper calldata), the recommended ordering would be:
1. Arbitrum, Optimism, ... first (with larger proofs on these cheaper chains)
2. Ethereum last (with minimal proof data on this expensive chain)

## Rationale

The hybrid approach of balanced Merkle trees combined with sequential hash chaining is chosen for several reasons:

1. **Gas Efficiency**: Traditional Merkle trees would require including proofs for all cross-chain operations, which becomes inefficient as the number of chains increases. The unhinged approach allows each chain to only process what's relevant to it.

2. **Simplicity**: The verification algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement in smart contracts, requiring only basic hash operations.

3. **Flexibility**: The structure can accommodate an arbitrary number of chains and operations per chain without significant complexity increases.

4. **Compatibility**: The approach is compatible with existing EIP-712 signatures and can be integrated into current cross-chain protocols.

The name "Unhinged" Merkle Tree reflects that the top-level structure deliberately deviates from the traditional balanced approach, creating an "unhinged" but more efficient structure for cross-chain applications.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is fully compatible with existing Ethereum standards and does not require any changes to the Ethereum protocol. It can be implemented in smart contracts using existing Solidity functions.

## Security Considerations

### Proof Ordering

The security of Unhinged Merkle Trees depends on the consistent ordering of operations and chains. Implementations must ensure that:

1. Operations within each chain's balanced subtree are ordered consistently
2. Chains are processed in the specified canonical order
3. The verification algorithm correctly processes the subtree proof nodes

### Replay Protection

Cross-chain proofs should include appropriate replay protection mechanisms such as:

1. Chain-specific identifiers to prevent proofs from being reused across different chains
2. Nonces or timestamps to prevent proofs from being reused within the same chain
3. Expiration times to limit the validity period of proofs

### Root Signing

The Unhinged Root should be signed using secure methods such as EIP-712, which provides structured data signing with domain separation.

1. **Cross-Chain Permit Systems**: Allowing a single signature to authorize token operations across multiple chains
2. **Governance Systems**: Enabling single-signature voting across multiple chains
3. **Bridging Protocols**: Providing efficient verification of cross-chain transfers
4. **Distributed Identity**: Attesting to account ownership across chains
5. **Cross-Chain NFTs**: Proving ownership across multiple chains
6. **Layer 2 Rollups**: Creating compact proofs for multi-rollup systems
