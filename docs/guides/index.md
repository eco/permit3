## Getting Started

If you're new to Permit3, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md), which covers basic integration and common operations.

For more advanced use cases, check out the specific guides for witness functionality and cross-chain operations.

## Common Use Cases

### Basic Token Approval

Permit3 enables signature-based token approvals for any ERC20 token:

```solidity
permit3.permit(
    owner,
    salt,
    deadline,
    timestamp,
    chainPermits,
    signature
);
```

### Direct Token Transfer

Permit3 can also directly transfer tokens with a signature:

```solidity
IPermit3.AllowanceOrTransfer memory permitData = IPermit3.AllowanceOrTransfer({
    modeOrExpiration: 0, // Transfer mode
    token: tokenAddress,
    account: recipientAddress,
    amountDelta: amount
});
```
