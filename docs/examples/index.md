# Permit3 Examples

This section provides practical examples of implementing and using Permit3.

## Available Examples

- [Witness Example](./witness-example.md): Implementing witness functionality in a decentralized exchange
- [Cross-Chain Example](./cross-chain-example.md): Working with permits across multiple chains
- [Allowance Management Example](./allowance-management-example.md): Managing token allowances with different modes
- [Security Example](./security-example.md): Implementing secure permit operations
- [Integration Example](./integration-example.md): Integrating Permit3 into existing systems

## Example Use Cases

### Decentralized Exchange with Witness Functionality

The [Witness Example](./witness-example.md) demonstrates how to implement a decentralized exchange using Permit3's witness functionality for order verification.

### Cross-Chain Token Bridge

The [Cross-Chain Example](./cross-chain-example.md) shows how to implement a token bridge using Permit3's cross-chain capabilities.

### Token Management System

The [Allowance Management Example](./allowance-management-example.md) demonstrates how to create a comprehensive token management system using Permit3's flexible allowance modes.

### Secure Multi-Signature Wallet

The [Security Example](./security-example.md) shows how to implement a secure multi-signature wallet using Permit3's witness functionality.

## Working with the Examples

Each example includes:

1. **Use Case Description**: Overview of the example use case
2. **Contract Implementation**: Solidity code for implementing the example
3. **Client-Side Code**: JavaScript code for interacting with the contracts
4. **Step-by-Step Guide**: Detailed instructions for implementing the example
5. **Advanced Variations**: More complex variations of the basic example

These examples are designed to be practical starting points for your own implementations of Permit3.
