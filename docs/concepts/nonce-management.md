# 🔏 Permit3 Nonce Management 🔢

This document explains Permit3's approach to nonce management, which provides efficient replay protection for permits across multiple chains.

## Overview

Nonce management is a critical security component in any system that processes signatures. In Permit3, nonces prevent replay attacks by ensuring each signature can only be used once. Unlike traditional sequential nonce systems, Permit3 implements a bitmap-based approach that offers several advantages:

1. **Gas Efficiency**: Constant gas cost regardless of nonce value
2. **Concurrent Operations**: Support for executing multiple permits in parallel
3. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Efficient nonce management across multiple blockchains
4. **Salt-Based Flexibility**: User-controlled nonce selection through salts

## Bitmap-Based Nonce System

### How It Works

Permit3 uses a bitmap-based approach to track nonce usage:

1. Each user has a mapping of 256-bit words that represent nonce status
2. Each word can track 256 different nonces (one per bit)
3. Salts determine which bit in which word to use
4. Setting a bit to 1 marks that nonce as used

```solidity
// Nonce storage
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public nonceBitmap;

// Using a nonce
function _useNonce(address owner, bytes32 salt) internal {
    uint256 wordPos = uint256(salt) / 256;
    uint256 bitPos = uint256(salt) % 256;
    uint256 bit = 1 << bitPos;
    
    nonceBitmap[owner][wordPos] |= bit;
    
    emit NonceUsed(owner, salt);
}
```

### Nonce Calculation

The position in the bitmap is calculated from the salt:

- **Word Position**: `uint256(salt) / 256`
- **Bit Position**: `uint256(salt) % 256`

For example, with a salt value of 1234:
- Word Position: 1234 / 256 = 4
- Bit Position: 1234 % 256 = 210
- The 210th bit in the 4th word would be set to 1

### Checking Nonce Status

To check if a nonce has been used:

```solidity
function _hasNonce(address owner, bytes32 salt) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 wordPos = uint256(salt) / 256;
    uint256 bitPos = uint256(salt) % 256;
    uint256 bit = 1 << bitPos;
    
    return nonceBitmap[owner][wordPos] & bit != 0;
}
```

## Advantages of Bitmap Nonces

### 1. Gas Efficiency

The bitmap approach has a constant gas cost regardless of the nonce value:

- **Setting a Bit**: ~5,000 gas (one SSTORE operation)
- **Checking a Bit**: ~200 gas (one SLOAD operation)

This is much more efficient than sequential nonces for high values, which can cost tens of thousands of gas for large nonce values.

### 2. Concurrent Operations

With sequential nonces, operations must execute in order to avoid nonce conflicts. Bitmap nonces allow concurrent operations by using different salts:

```javascript
// Operation 1
const salt1 = ethers.utils.randomBytes(32);
const signature1 = signPermit(owner, salt1, deadline, permits1);

// Operation 2 (can execute concurrently)
const salt2 = ethers.utils.randomBytes(32);
const signature2 = signPermit(owner, salt2, deadline, permits2);
```

Both operations can be submitted and executed independently, even if one gets delayed.

### 3. Cross-Chain Compatibility

Bitmap nonces are ideal for cross-chain operations because:

- Each chain can track its own nonce bitmap
- Operations on different chains can use the same salt value
- Nonce invalidation can be propagated across chains

### 4. User-Controlled Salts

Users have flexibility in how they generate salts:

- **Random Salts**: Maximum concurrency, unpredictable
- **Structured Salts**: Organize permits by purpose or system
- **Deterministic Salts**: Generated from permit data for recovery

## Salt Generation Strategies

### 1. Random Salts

The simplest approach is to generate a cryptographically secure random salt for each signature:

```javascript
const salt = ethers.utils.randomBytes(32);
```

This provides maximum concurrency and unpredictability but requires tracking used salts.

### 2. Structured Salts

Salts can encode information about the permit's purpose:

```javascript
// Salt for a specific application and action
const salt = ethers.utils.keccak256(
    ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ['string', 'string', 'uint256'],
        ['MyApp', 'SwapTokens', Date.now()]
    )
);
```

This makes salts more meaningful and traceable.

### 3. Deterministic Salts

Salts can be derived from permit data for recovery purposes:

```javascript
// Salt derived from permit data
const salt = ethers.utils.keccak256(
    ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ['address', 'address', 'uint256', 'uint256'],
        [tokenAddress, spenderAddress, amount, expiration]
    )
);
```

This allows reconstructing the salt if the original is lost.

## Nonce Invalidation

Permit3 provides a function to invalidate nonces explicitly:

```solidity
function invalidateNonces(address owner, bytes32 salt) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
    
    uint256 wordPos = uint256(salt) / 256;
    uint256 bitPos = uint256(salt) % 256;
    uint256 bit = 1 << bitPos;
    
    nonceBitmap[owner][wordPos] |= bit;
    
    emit NonceInvalidation(owner, salt);
}
```

This function allows users to invalidate a nonce without executing a permit, which can be useful for:

1. Canceling pending permits
2. Mitigating compromised signatures
3. Implementing emergency security measures

## Cross-Chain Nonce Management

Permit3's nonce system is particularly well-suited for cross-chain operations:

### 1. Independent Nonce Tracking

Each chain maintains its own nonce bitmap, allowing independent verification:

```
Chain A: nonceBitmap[owner][wordPos] = 0x0000...0001
Chain B: nonceBitmap[owner][wordPos] = 0x0000...0001
```

### 2. Nonce Propagation

For additional security, nonces can be propagated across chains:

```solidity
// On Chain A
function propagateNonceToChainB(bytes32 salt) external {
    // Mark nonce as used on Chain A
    _useNonce(msg.sender, salt);
    
    // Send message to Chain B through bridge
    bridge.sendMessage(
        CHAIN_B_ID,
        PERMIT3_CONTRACT_B,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            INonceManager.invalidateNonces.selector,
            msg.sender,
            salt
        )
    );
}
```

This prevents signatures from being reused across chains for better security.

### 3. Cross-Chain Salt Management

In cross-chain scenarios, consider these salt management strategies:

- **Chain-Specific Salts**: Derive salts from the chain ID to prevent cross-chain reuse
- **Global Salts**: Use the same salt across chains when the signature authorizes operations on multiple chains
- **Hierarchical Salts**: Derive child salts from a master salt for related cross-chain operations

## Security Considerations

### 1. Salt Collision

With randomly generated salts, the probability of collision is extremely low but not zero. For critical applications:

- Use structured salts that include unique identifiers
- Verify nonce status before relying on a new salt
- Implement additional replay protection (e.g., deadlines)

### 2. Front-Running

Nonces can be front-run by malicious users. To mitigate:

- Use deadlines to limit the window of vulnerability
- Include recipient addresses in signature data when possible
- Consider using commit-reveal schemes for sensitive operations

### 3. Cross-Chain Replay

Cross-chain replay attacks can occur if the same signature is valid on multiple chains. To prevent:

- Include chain ID in the permit data
- Verify chain ID in permit processing
- Use chain-specific salts when appropriate

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Salt Generation

- Use cryptographically secure random number generators for salt creation
- Consider adding a timestamp or nonce to ensure uniqueness
- For structured salts, include sufficient entropy to prevent guessing

### 2. Nonce Verification

- Always verify nonce status before relying on permit validity
- Implement proper error handling for used nonces
- Log nonce usage for audit purposes

### 3. Salt Management

- Store salt values securely if they need to be referenced later
- Consider implementing salt recovery mechanisms for important permits
- Document salt generation strategy for maintainability

## Conclusion

Permit3's bitmap-based nonce system provides gas-efficient, concurrent, and cross-chain compatible replay protection. By understanding how the system works and implementing appropriate salt management strategies, developers can build secure and efficient applications on top of Permit3.

The non-sequential nature of the nonce system is a key innovation that enables Permit3's cross-chain capabilities and supports the concurrent operation patterns that are essential for modern blockchain applications.
