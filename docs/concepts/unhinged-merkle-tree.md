## ü§î What are Unhinged Merkle Trees?

Unhinged Merkle Trees are a hybrid data structure that combines two organizational principles: balanced merkle trees for efficient membership proofs and sequential hash chaining for cross-chain linking. 

The key insight is the **two-part design**:
- **Bottom Part**: A balanced merkle tree that provides efficient O(log n) membership proofs
- **Top Part**: A sequential hash chain that efficiently links operations across multiple chains

Uses merkle tree verification for security and compatibility.

<a id="why-unhinged"></a>
## üè∑Ô∏è Why "Unhinged"?

The name "Unhinged" reflects the deliberate deviation from traditional balanced merkle tree structures at the top level. In a traditional merkle tree, every level maintains a balanced "hinged" structure. However, for cross-chain operations, this constraint becomes suboptimal.

The Unhinged Merkle Tree becomes "unhinged" from this balanced constraint at the top level:
- **Bottom stays "hinged"**: Maintains balanced structure for efficient membership proofs
- **Top becomes "unhinged"**: Uses sequential chaining optimized for cross-chain operations

This creates a more efficient structure for cross-chain applications while maintaining the benefits of balanced trees where they matter most.

## üß© Key Structure: The Two-Part Hybrid Design

The foundation of Unhinged Merkle Trees is the two-part structure:

```
               [H1] ‚Üí [H2] ‚Üí [H3] ‚Üí ROOT  ‚Üê Sequential chain (top part)
            /      \      \      \
          [BR]    [D5]   [D6]   [D7]      ‚Üê Additional chain data
         /     \
     [BH1]     [BH2]                      ‚Üê Balanced tree (bottom part)
    /    \     /    \
  [D1]  [D2] [D3]  [D4]                   ‚Üê Leaf data
```

### Two-Part Structure:

1. üîΩ **Bottom Part - Balanced Merkle Tree**:
   - Maintains traditional balanced structure for efficient membership proofs
   - [BR] is the balanced root providing O(log n) verification
   - [BH1], [BH2] are balanced hash nodes
   - [D1]-[D4] are the leaf data points (individual operations)
   - Perfect for proving membership within a single chain's operations
   
2. üîº **Top Part - Sequential Hash Chain**:
   - Deviates from balanced structure for cross-chain optimization
   - Starts with balanced root [BR] as foundation
   - Incorporates additional data [D5], [D6], [D7] (other chain operations)  
   - Creates sequential chain: H1 = hash(BR, D5), H2 = hash(H1, D6), etc.
   - Optimized for gas efficiency across multiple chains

### How It Works

Unhinged Merkle Trees use merkle tree verification for simplicity:
- Uses ordered hashing (smaller value first) for consistency
- Provides O(log n) membership proofs
- Maintains security guarantees through battle-tested patterns

The two-part structure guides the design philosophy and enables future optimizations.

<a id="how-the-two-parts-work-together"></a>
## How It Works

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - Each chain's operations are hashed into leaf nodes
   - Leaves are paired and hashed to create parent nodes
   - Process continues until a single root is reached
   - The root represents all operations across all chains
   
2. **Proof Generation**:
   - To prove inclusion of a specific operation
   - Provide the sibling hashes along the path from leaf to root
   - These siblings allow reconstruction of the root
   - Typically requires log‚ÇÇ(n) hashes for n operations

<a id="applied-to-cross-chain-use-cases"></a>
## Applied to Cross-Chain Use Cases

In the cross-chain context:
- Each chain's operations form leaf nodes in the merkle tree
- All operations across all chains are included in a single tree
- The merkle root is what gets signed by the user

This allows each chain to:
1. Efficiently verify its own operations with a merkle proof
2. Trust that other chains' operations are included in the same root
3. Minimize gas usage with compact proofs (only log‚ÇÇ(n) hashes needed)

<a id="gas-optimization-through-chain-ordering"></a>
### Gas Optimization Through Chain Ordering

The two-part structure enables strategic gas optimization:

**Chain Ordering Strategy**:
- Place chains with cheaper calldata (L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism) earlier in the sequence
- Place chains with expensive calldata (Ethereum mainnet) at the end
- This minimizes proof size for expensive chains while allowing larger proofs on cheaper chains

**Benefits**:
1. **Strategic Ordering**: Expensive chains positioned last receive smaller proofs
2. **Cost Distribution**: Larger proofs handled by chains with cheaper calldata
3. **Proof Size Optimization**: Chain position directly affects proof size requirements
4. **Minimal Calldata**: Later chains need fewer sibling hashes in their proofs

The Unhinged Merkle Tree approach provides:
- Consistent O(log n) verification complexity
- Minimal calldata requirements (log‚ÇÇ(n) hashes per proof)
- Gas-optimized verification
- Future extensibility for chain ordering optimizations

<a id="proof-structure"></a>
## Proof Structure

The proof structure is:

```solidity
struct UnhingedProof {
    bytes32[] nodes;    // Array of sibling hashes from leaf to root
}
```

This streamlined structure contains:

- **nodes**: An array of sibling hashes that form the merkle proof path
  - Each hash is a sibling node needed to reconstruct the path to the root
  - Follows standard merkle proof format for maximum compatibility
  - Number of nodes = ceiling(log‚ÇÇ(total leaves))
  - **Key benefit**: Represents the efficient path through both parts of the hybrid structure

### How Merkle Proofs Work

To verify that a leaf is part of the tree:

1. Start with the leaf value (hash of the operation data)
2. For each proof node:
   - Combine the current hash with the proof node
   - Order them (smaller value first) and hash together
   - This gives you the parent node hash
3. Continue until you reach the root
4. Compare the calculated root with the expected root

### Gas Efficiency

This structure provides excellent gas efficiency:

- **Minimal Calldata**: Only essential sibling hashes, no complex proof structures
- **No Overhead**: No packed counts or flags to decode
- **Predictable Costs**: Gas usage scales logarithmically with tree size
- **Optimized Verification**: Battle-tested approach
- **Future-Ready**: Two-part foundation enables future optimizations
- **Chain Ordering Benefits**: Strategic ordering can minimize proof sizes on expensive chains

<a id="verification-process"></a>
## Verification Process

To verify that an element is included in an Unhinged Merkle Tree:

1. **Calculate the leaf hash**:
   - Hash the operation data to get the leaf value
   - This represents the specific operation being verified

2. **Process the merkle proof**:
   - Start with the leaf hash
   - For each sibling hash in the proof:
     - Order the two hashes (smaller first)
     - Combine them: `parent = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(left, right))`
     - Move up to the next level

3. **Verification**:
   - Compare the final calculated hash against the signed root
   - If they match, the operation is proven to be part of the tree

## Usage in Permit3

Permit3 uses Unhinged Merkle Trees through a clean architecture:

- `UnhingedMerkleTree.sol`: Merkle tree verification logic
- `IUnhingedMerkleTree.sol`: Simple interface defining the streamlined proof structure  
- Integration with `Permit3.sol` for cross-chain permit operations
- **Foundation**: The two-part hybrid design guides the overall architecture

The following functions are provided:

```solidity
// Verify a leaf is included in the merkle tree
function verify(
    UnhingedProof calldata proof,
    bytes32 unhingedRoot,
    bytes32 leaf
) internal pure returns (bool)

// Calculate the merkle root from a leaf and proof
function calculateRoot(
    UnhingedProof calldata proof,
    bytes32 leaf
) internal pure returns (bytes32)

// Alternative verification function for compatibility
function verifyProof(
    bytes32 root,
    bytes32 leaf,
    bytes32[] memory proof
) internal pure returns (bool)
```

## Example: Cross-Chain Permit with Unhinged Merkle Tree

Here's how Unhinged Merkle Trees are used in a cross-chain permit scenario:

1. **Tree Construction** (Two-Part Process):
   - **Bottom Part**: Collect operations within each chain, build balanced subtrees
   - **Top Part**: Chain the subtree roots sequentially for cross-chain linking
   - **Result**: Standard merkle tree built from all chain operations
   - The root represents operations across all chains with hybrid efficiency

2. **Signature Creation**:
   - The user signs the merkle root using EIP-712
   - Single signature leverages both balanced and sequential benefits
   - Authorizes operations across all chains efficiently

3. **Chain-Specific Verification**:
   - On each chain, verify the specific operations for that chain
   - Merkle proof connects local operations to the global signed root
   - **Key benefit**: Proof traverses both balanced and sequential parts efficiently

### Code Example

```solidity
// Create permits for multiple chains
ChainPermits memory ethereumPermits = ChainPermits({
    chainId: 1,
    permits: [/* Ethereum permits */]
});

ChainPermits memory arbitrumPermits = ChainPermits({
    chainId: 42161,
    permits: [/* Arbitrum permits */]
});

// Hash each chain's permits to create leaves
bytes32 ethereumLeaf = hashChainPermits(ethereumPermits);
bytes32 arbitrumLeaf = hashChainPermits(arbitrumPermits);

// Build merkle tree and get root
// (This would typically be done off-chain)
bytes32[] memory leaves = new bytes32[](2);
leaves[0] = ethereumLeaf;
leaves[1] = arbitrumLeaf;
bytes32 merkleRoot = buildMerkleRoot(leaves);

// Sign the merkle root
bytes signature = signMessage(merkleRoot);

// Later, on Arbitrum
// Generate merkle proof for Arbitrum's leaf
bytes32[] memory arbitrumProof = generateMerkleProof(leaves, 1); // Index 1 for Arbitrum

UnhingedPermitProof memory proof = {
    permits: arbitrumPermits,
    unhingedProof: arbitrumProof
};

// Verify and process
permit3.permitUnhinged(owner, salt, deadline, timestamp, proof, signature);
```
