## ü§î What are Unhinged Merkle Trees?

Unhinged Merkle Trees are a hybrid data structure that combines two proven cryptographic patterns in a specific, two-part structure:

1. üî∂ **Balanced Merkle Trees** for a subset of nodes (typically operations within a single chain)
2. ‚õìÔ∏è **Sequential Hash Chaining** for efficiently linking multiple subtree roots across chains

This approach was specifically designed to solve the problem of cross-chain proofs while optimizing for gas efficiency, where each blockchain only needs to process what's relevant to it.

<a id="why-unhinged"></a>
## üè∑Ô∏è Why "Unhinged"?

The name "Unhinged" refers to the deliberate deviation from traditional balanced Merkle trees at the top level. Unlike classic Merkle trees that maintain balance throughout, Unhinged Merkle Trees use an "unhinged" (sequential) structure at the top level to optimize for cross-chain verifications.

<a id="key-structure-a-two-part-design"></a>
## üß© Key Structure: A Two-Part Design

The key insight of the Unhinged Merkle Tree is its two-part structure:

```
               [H1] ‚Üí [H2] ‚Üí [H3] ‚Üí ROOT
            /      \      \      \
          [BR]    [D5]   [D6]   [D7]  
         /     \
     [BH1]     [BH2]
    /    \     /    \
[D1]    [D2] [D3]  [D4]
```

This diagram clearly shows the two distinct parts:

1. üîΩ **Bottom Part (Balanced Tree)**:
   - A standard balanced Merkle tree with:
   - Leaf data points [D1], [D2], [D3], [D4]
   - Intermediate balanced hash nodes [BH1], [BH2]
   - Balanced root [BR]
   
2. üîº **Top Part (Sequential Chain)**:
   - A linear hash chain that:
   - Starts with the balanced root [BR]
   - Sequentially incorporates additional data [D5], [D6], [D7]
   - Forms hash chain [H1] ‚Üí [H2] ‚Üí [H3] ‚Üí ROOT

This hybrid approach gives us the benefits of both structures:
- Efficient membership proofs from the balanced part 
- Sequential processing efficiency from the chain part
- Ability to include both tree-structured and sequential data in one root

<a id="how-the-two-parts-work-together"></a>
## How the Two Parts Work Together

1. **Balanced Subtree**:
   - Operations within a single chain are organized in a balanced Merkle tree
   - This provides efficient inclusion proofs with O(log n) complexity
   - The root of this tree ([H1'] in the diagram) serves as the anchor point
   
2. **Unhinged Chain**:
   - The balanced subtree root is the starting point
   - Additional hashes ([H1], [H2], [H3]) are appended sequentially
   - Each hash represents data that should be included but doesn't need the efficiency of a balanced tree
   - The final hash in the chain is the Unhinged Root that gets signed

<a id="applied-to-cross-chain-use-cases"></a>
## Applied to Cross-Chain Use Cases

In the cross-chain context:
- The **balanced subtree** contains operations for the current chain (requiring efficient proofs)
- The **unhinged chain** contains hashes representing operations on other chains (sequential for efficiency)

This allows each chain to:
1. Efficiently verify its own operations (balanced tree part)
2. Include other chains' operations in the overall signed root (unhinged chain part)
3. Minimize gas usage by only processing what's relevant to the current chain

<a id="gas-optimization-through-chain-ordering"></a>
### Gas Optimization Through Chain Ordering

A critical aspect of Unhinged Merkle Trees for cross-chain operations is the strategic ordering of chains based on their calldata costs:

- **Expensive Chains Last**: Chains with higher calldata costs (like Ethereum mainnet) should be positioned at the end of the unhinged chain
- **Cheap Chains First**: Chains with lower calldata costs (like most L2s) should be positioned earlier in the chain sequence

This ordering strategy provides substantial gas savings because:

1. **Minimal Proof Size for Expensive Chains**: Chains at the end of the sequence only need a simple preHash value for verification, minimizing expensive calldata
2. **Larger Proofs on Cheaper Chains**: Chains at the beginning of the sequence require more proof data, but this is more affordable on networks with lower calldata costs
3. **Optimized Distribution**: The balanced subtree portion can contain many operations on cheaper chains, while expensive chains can have their operations be minimal

By ordering chains according to their calldata costs, a single signature can authorize operations across multiple networks while ensuring optimal gas efficiency on each chain.

<a id="proof-structure"></a>
## Proof Structure

Permits3 uses an optimized proof structure for Unhinged Merkle Trees:

```solidity
struct UnhingedProof {
    bytes32[] nodes;    // All nodes: [preHash (if present), subtreeProof nodes..., followingHashes...]
    bytes32 counts;     // Packed counts:
                        // - First 120 bits: subtreeProofCount (shifted 136 bits)
                        // - Next 120 bits: followingHashesCount (shifted 16 bits)
                        // - Next 15 bits: Reserved for future use
                        // - Last bit: hasPreHash flag (1 if present, 0 if not)
}
```

This compact representation contains three key components:

1. **preHash** (optional): The combined hash of all previous chain operations. Can be completely omitted to save gas when not needed.
2. **subtreeProof**: A traditional Merkle proof for the elements in the current chain's subtree
3. **followingHashes**: Array of subtree roots for chains that should be processed after the current chain

### Gas Optimization with hasPreHash Flag

The `hasPreHash` flag provides significant gas optimization by allowing proofs to completely omit the preHash when it's not needed, rather than including a zero bytes32 value. This results in:

- **Reduced calldata size**: Each omitted preHash saves 32 bytes of calldata, resulting in significant gas savings
- **Simplified verification flow**: When hasPreHash=false, verification starts directly with the subtree root
- **Lower transaction costs**: Particularly beneficial for the first chain in a sequence or for single-chain operations

Our benchmarks show significant gas savings on typical transactions using this optimization.

#### When to Use hasPreHash=false

You should set hasPreHash=false in these scenarios:
- For the first chain in a sequence (no previous chains to hash)
- For single-chain operations (no cross-chain verification needed)
- When optimizing for minimal calldata size and gas costs

#### When to Use hasPreHash=true

You should set hasPreHash=true in these scenarios:
- For chains in the middle or end of a sequence
- When verification depends on the combined hash of previous chains
- When preserving the complete verification path is important

<a id="verification-process"></a>
## Verification Process

To verify that an element is included in an Unhinged Merkle Tree:

1. **Verify the balanced subtree proof**:
   - Use standard Merkle proof verification to check that the element is included in the current chain's subtree
   - Calculate the subtree root

2. **Recalculate the unhinged chain**:
   - If hasPreHash is true:
     - Start with `preHash` from nodes[0]
     - Append the calculated subtree root: `result = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(preHash, subtreeRoot))`
   - If hasPreHash is false:
     - Start directly with the subtree root: `result = subtreeRoot`
   - Sequentially append each following hash: `result = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(result, followingHash))`

3. **Verification**:
   - Compare the final calculated hash against the signed Unhinged Root
   - If they match, the proof is valid

<a id="implementation-in-permit3"></a>
## Implementation in Permit3

Permit3 implements Unhinged Merkle Trees through:

- `UnhingedMerkleTree.sol`: A library implementing the core functionality
- `IUnhingedMerkleTree.sol`: An interface defining the proof structure and verification methods
- Integration with `Permit3.sol` for cross-chain permit operations

The following functions are provided:

```solidity
// Verify a leaf is included in the unhinged merkle tree
function verify(
    bytes32 leaf,
    UnhingedProof calldata proof,
    bytes32 unhingedRoot
) internal pure returns (bool)

// Verify a leaf is part of a balanced merkle subtree
function verifyBalancedSubtree(
    bytes32 leaf,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) internal pure returns (bytes32)

// Create an unhinged root from a list of balanced subtree roots
function createUnhingedRoot(bytes32[] calldata subtreeRoots) internal pure returns (bytes32)

// Helper for extracting/packing counts
function extractCounts(bytes32 counts) internal pure returns (uint120 subtreeProofCount, uint120 followingHashesCount, bool hasPreHash)
function packCounts(uint120 subtreeProofCount, uint120 followingHashesCount, bool hasPreHash) internal pure returns (bytes32)
```

## Example: Cross-Chain Permit with Unhinged Merkle Tree

Here's how Unhinged Merkle Trees are used in a cross-chain permit scenario:

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - Create balanced Merkle trees for operations on each chain
   - Calculate the root hash for each tree
   - Chain these roots together to form the Unhinged Root

2. **Signature Creation**:
   - The user signs the Unhinged Root using EIP-712
   - This single signature authorizes operations across all chains

3. **Chain-Specific Verification**:
   - On each chain, only verify:
     - The specific operations for that chain
     - The connection to the Unhinged Root via the proof

### Code Example

```solidity
// Create permits for multiple chains
ChainPermits memory ethereumPermits = ChainPermits({
    chainId: 1,
    permits: [/* Ethereum permits */]
});

ChainPermits memory arbitrumPermits = ChainPermits({
    chainId: 42161,
    permits: [/* Arbitrum permits */]
});

// Create balanced Merkle trees and get roots
bytes32 ethereumRoot = hashChainPermits(ethereumPermits);
bytes32 arbitrumRoot = hashChainPermits(arbitrumPermits);

// Create the unhinged chain
bytes32[] memory roots = new bytes32[](2);
roots[0] = ethereumRoot;
roots[1] = arbitrumRoot;
bytes32 unhingedRoot = UnhingedMerkleTree.createUnhingedRoot(roots);

// Sign the unhinged root
bytes signature = signMessage(unhingedRoot);

// Later, on Arbitrum
UnhingedPermitProof memory proof = {
    permits: arbitrumPermits,
    unhingedProof: UnhingedMerkleTree.createOptimizedProof(
        ethereumRoot,  // preHash (only Ethereum came before)
        [], // No subtree proof needed for the root
        []  // No following hashes
        // hasPreHash flag is automatically set to true since preHash is non-zero
    )
};

// Verify and process
permit3.permitUnhinged(owner, salt, deadline, timestamp, proof, signature);
```
