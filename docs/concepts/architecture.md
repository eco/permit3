# Permit3 Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Permit3 architecture, explaining how its components work together to enable cross-chain token approvals and transfers.

<a id="overview"></a>
## Overview

Permit3 is a cross-chain token approval and transfer system that extends the functionality of Permit2 with advanced features:

1.  **Cross-Chain Operations**: Execute approvals and transfers across multiple blockchains with a single signature
2.  **Non-Sequential Nonces**: Enable concurrent operations and optimize gas usage
3.  **Flexible Allowance Management**: Support time-bound permissions with various operation modes
4.  **Witness Functionality**: Attach arbitrary data to permits for enhanced verification
5.  **EIP-712 Typed Signatures**: Secure signature verification with structured data

<a id="core-components"></a>
## Core Components

The Permit3 system consists of three main components:

### Permit3 Contract

The main contract that inherits from PermitBase and NonceManager, implementing the core functionality:

- Processes permit signatures for approvals and transfers
- Verifies EIP-712 signatures with standard and witness data
- Handles cross-chain operations through hash chaining
- Implements witness functionality for custom data verification

### PermitBase Contract

Manages token approvals and transfers:

- Tracks allowances with amounts and expiration times
- Handles token transfers through approvals
- Implements allowance modes (increase, decrease, lock, unlock)
- Provides emergency account locking functionality

### NonceManager Contract

Handles nonce management for replay protection:

- Uses non-sequential nonces for gas efficiency
- Supports cross-chain nonce invalidation
- Implements salt-based signature replay protection
- Provides domain separation for EIP-712 signatures

## Key Data Structures

### Allowance Structure

```solidity
struct Allowance {
    uint160 amount;        // Approved amount
    uint48 expiration;     // Timestamp when approval expires
    uint48 timestamp;      // Timestamp when approval was set
}
```

### AllowanceOrTransfer Structure

```solidity
struct AllowanceOrTransfer {
    uint48 modeOrExpiration;  // Operation mode or expiration time
    address token;            // Token address
    address account;          // Spender or recipient
    uint160 amountDelta;      // Amount change
}
```

### ChainPermits Structure

```solidity
struct ChainPermits {
    uint64 chainId;              // Target chain ID (uint64 for gas optimization)
    AllowanceOrTransfer[] permits; // Operations for this chain
}
```

### Cross-Chain Permit Parameters

In the implementation, cross-chain operations use separate parameters:

```solidity
function permit(
    address owner,
    bytes32 salt,
    uint48 deadline,
    uint48 timestamp,
    ChainPermits calldata permits,    // Permit operations for the current chain
    bytes32[] calldata proof,         // Standard merkle proof using OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof
    bytes calldata signature
) external;

// Uses OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof.processProof() with bytes32[] arrays
// Each element represents a sibling hash needed for proof verification
```

## Core Operations

### 1. Permit Processing

Permit3 supports two main permit functions:

1. **Single Chain Permits**:
   - Process token approvals for a specific chain
   - Verify signature against chain permits
   - Update allowances or execute transfers

2. **Cross-Chain Permits**:
   - Process token approvals across multiple chains
   - Chain permit hashes together for verification
   - Execute operations on current chain only

Both functions can be extended with witness functionality to include custom data in signature verification.

### 2. Allowance Management

Permit3 supports five operation modes controlled by the `modeOrExpiration` parameter:

1. **Transfer Mode** (`modeOrExpiration = 0`):
   - Executes immediate token transfer
   - `account` field represents recipient
   - `amountDelta` represents transfer amount

2. **Decrease Mode** (`modeOrExpiration = 1`):
   - Reduces existing allowance
   - `amountDelta` represents decrease amount
   - Special case: `type(uint160).max` resets to 0

3. **Lock Mode** (`modeOrExpiration = 2`):
   - Locks allowance for security
   - Blocks any increases or transfers
   - Requires newer timestamp to unlock

4. **Unlock Mode** (`modeOrExpiration = 3`):
   - Cancels locked state
   - Sets new allowance amount
   - Requires newer timestamp than lock

5. **Increase Mode** (`modeOrExpiration > 3`):
   - Value represents expiration timestamp
   - Increases allowance by `amountDelta`
   - Updates expiration if timestamp is newer

### 3. Nonce Management

Permit3 uses non-sequential nonces with salt parameters:

```solidity
function _useNonce(address owner, bytes32 salt) internal {
    if (usedNonces[owner][salt] != NONCE_NOT_USED) {
        revert NonceAlreadyUsed(owner, salt);
    }
    usedNonces[owner][salt] = NONCE_USED;
}
```

This approach:
- Enables concurrent operations with different salts
- Optimizes gas usage compared to sequential nonces
- Supports cross-chain nonce management
- Prevents signature replay attacks

### 4. Witness Functionality

Witness functionality extends the standard permit flow:

1. **Type String Construction**:
   ```solidity
   bytes32 typeHash = keccak256(
       abi.encodePacked(PERMIT_WITNESS_TYPEHASH_STUB, witnessTypeString)
   );
   ```

2. **Signature Verification**:
   ```solidity
   bytes32 signedHash = keccak256(
       abi.encode(
           typeHash,
           permitDataHash,
           owner,
           salt,
           deadline,
           timestamp,
           witness
       )
   );
   ```

3. **Processing**:
   After verification, the permit is processed using the standard flow while the application can verify the witness data.

<a id="cross-chain-mechanism"></a>
## Cross-Chain Mechanism

Permit3 enables cross-chain operations through Unbalanced Merkle Trees:

1. Hash permits for each chain individually 
2. Build an Unbalanced Merkle Tree from all chain hashes (two-part structure)
3. Sign the Unbalanced root
4. Generate Unbalanced proofs for each chain  
5. Process the portion relevant to the current chain

This approach leverages the two-part design:
- **Bottom Part**: Efficient membership proofs within individual chains
- **Top Part**: Unbalanced upper structure that minimizes calldata for chains with high gas costs
- **Verification**: Merkle tree verification for security and compatibility
- **Benefits**: One signature for multiple chains with gas optimization potential
- **Security**: Chain ID validation prevents cross-chain replay attacks
- **Extensibility**: Supports witness data across chains with future optimization opportunities

### Unbalanced Merkle tree Example

```solidity
// Calculate the leaf hash for this chain's permits  
bytes32 leaf = permit3.hashChainPermits(proof.permits);

// Verify the Unbalanced Merkle Tree proof using OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof
// (traverses both balanced subtrees and unbalanced upper structure)
bool valid = MerkleProof.processProof(
    proof.proof,
    leaf
) == merkleRoot;

// Verify signature against Unbalanced root
bytes32 signedHash = keccak256(abi.encode(
    SIGNED_PERMIT3_TYPEHASH, 
    owner, 
    salt, 
    deadline, 
    timestamp, 
    merkleRoot  // The hybrid structure root
));
```
