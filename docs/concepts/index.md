## Core Components

Permit3 consists of three main components:

1. **Permit3 Contract**: Main contract implementing cross-chain token approvals and transfers
2. **PermitBase Contract**: Handles token approvals and transfers
3. **NonceManager Contract**: Provides nonce management for replay protection

These components work together to provide a flexible, secure, and gas-efficient system for token permissions across multiple blockchains.

## Key Concepts

### EIP-712 Signatures

Permit3 uses EIP-712 typed structured data for secure signature verification, providing users with clear information about what they're signing.

### Cross-Chain Operations

Permit3 enables operations across multiple blockchains with a single signature through hash chaining and Unhinged Merkle Trees.

### Unhinged Merkle Trees

Unhinged Merkle Trees combine balanced subtrees with sequential hash chaining to provide efficient cross-chain proofs while minimizing gas costs.

### Witness Functionality

Witness functionality allows including arbitrary data in permits for enhanced verification, enabling complex permission patterns.

### Non-Sequential Nonces

Permit3 uses a bitmap-based nonce system for gas-efficient replay protection, enabling concurrent operations.

### Flexible Allowance Management

The allowance system supports multiple operation modes, including transfers, increases, decreases, locking, and unlocking.
